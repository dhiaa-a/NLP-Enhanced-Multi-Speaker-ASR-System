# NLP-Enhanced Multi-Speaker ASR System - Current Status

## Working Components

-   ✅ Pattern-based NLP correction is working perfectly
-   ✅ Mock speaker separation (avoiding Windows symlink issues)
-   ✅ Whisper ASR initialized
-   ✅ Real-time correction with caching

## Key Fixes Applied

1. Changed speaker_separation model_type from "speechbrain" to "mock" in config.yaml
2. Fixed NLPErrorCorrector initialization to handle dict/string config
3. Pattern-based correction working with expanded dictionary
4. Added these corrections: consid→consider, deadl→deadline, fri→friday, he→hear, b→bad, exact→exactly, tha→that

## Current Issues

-   T5 model producing repetitive output (but pattern-based correction works fine)
-   SpeechBrain requires admin privileges on Windows (using mock separator instead)

## Test Commands That Work

```bash
python test_better_correction.py  # Shows corrections working
python scripts/run_demo.py        # Full demo
```
